  title: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
  description: A technical book on Designing and analysis of algorithms. The book covers 5 major approaches which are Divide and Conquer Algorithm, Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking and Branch & Bound. It covers NP-Hard and NP-Complete, which are research topics, and includes practical code in C++ of well known problems.
