# Chapter 1: Algorithm

## Algorithm
_"It is a set of well defined steps, which are followed to solve a problem"_

Example:
1. Brushing Teeth
2. Making Tea
3. Determine best profit for thief in a Knapsack
4. Help salesperson travel all cities with minimal cost to meet monthly targets

### Characteristics of an Algorithm
There are 5 key characteristics of an algorithm:-
#### 1. Definiteness
* Every step is meaningful and unambiguous for the reader.
* For example: Increase value of $x$ by $1$, instead of make $x$ bigger.

#### 2. Finiteness
* Every algorithm must have finite number of steps.

#### 3. Input
* An algorith must accept zero or more inputs.

#### 4. Output
* It must produce atleast one output.

#### 5. Effectiveness 
* It must be followed easily, even with pen and paper.

## Pseudo Code
1. It is the most effective way to represent an algorithm.
2. It is in normal english language.
3. It is written as a sequence of steps.

Example:
### Psuedo code for making a Tea

Steps are as follows:-
1. Get:
    1. A $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of drinking water
    2. A vessel (_patila_)
    3. A $\frac{1}{2}$ tea spoon of tea leaves (_chai patti_)
    4. Ginger (1 gram)
    5. 2 tea spoons of sugar
    6. A $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of milk
    7. Filter (_channi_)
2. Light the stove to medium flame and place vessel.
3. Put $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of water.
4. Add tea leaves, crushed ginger and sugar.
5. Wait till water begins to boil.
6. Add milk
7. Once the solution begins to boil, and comes to the brim of the vessel, turn off the flame.
8. Now, filter the tea from vessel to cup.

This is how we write Pseudo Code of a problem!
