# Chapter 1: Algorithm

## Algorithm
_"It is a set of well defined steps, which are followed to solve a problem"_

Example:
1. Brushing Teeth
2. Making Tea
3. Determine best profit for thief in a Knapsack
4. Help salesperson travel all cities with minimal cost to meet monthly targets

### Characteristics of an Algorithm
There are 5 key characteristics of an algorithm:-
#### 1. Definiteness
* Every step is meaningful and unambiguous for the reader.
* For example: Increase value of $x$ by $1$, instead of make $x$ bigger.

#### 2. Finiteness
* Every algorithm must have finite number of steps.

#### 3. Input
* An algorith must accept zero or more inputs.

#### 4. Output
* It must produce atleast one output.

#### 5. Effectiveness 
* It must be followed easily, even with pen and paper.

## Pseudo Code
1. It is the most effective way to represent an algorithm.
2. It is in normal english language.
3. It is written as a sequence of steps.

Example:
**Psuedo code for making a Tea**

Steps are as follows:-
1. Get:
    1. A \cfrac{3}{4} cup of drinking water.
