# Chapter 2: Divide and Conquer
1. It is one of the well known problem solving technique, where we breakdown a given problem and solve it.
2. Suppose we have to find marks of a student from the pile of marksheets (ordered alphabetically), so we can divide the pile into several parts based on starting letter alphabet of the name, like A, B, C ... Z.
3. To find marksheet of a student named Aditya, we will access Part A (containing marks of students name starting with A) only, and not required to access other part of the pile. Then we will find the marksheet of student.
